**INTRO:**
  The project for FlyAwayNow is a web-based application developed to provide a seamless and efficient bus ticket booking experience. The system allows users to register, log in, search for buses based on source, destination, and date, check seat availability, select seats, and make secure online payments using integrated payment gateways like Stripe or PayPal. It enhances convenience by offering instant booking confirmations, real-time updates, and a user-friendly interface. The front-end, built with React.js, ensures a responsive and interactive experience, while Node.js and Express.js handle the back-end logic by managing business rules and API requests. MongoDB serves as the database, storing user details, bus schedules, bookings, and transactions. The system also includes an admin panel for bus operators, allowing them to manage bus schedules, routes, fares, and reservations, ensuring smooth operational control. JWT is implemented for secure authentication, safeguarding user data and transactions. The platform follows a three-tier architecture separating the front-end, back-end, and database for scalability and maintainability. Using a RESTful API architecture, the system ensures seamless communication between components. This project eliminates the need for manual ticket booking, reduces errors, enhances security, and improves operational efficiency for bus operators, offering a modern, cashless, and hassle-free experience for passengers.
